# Aiko - Discord Bot 
Aiko is a simple Discord Bot made with the intension to delete messages containing bad words like swear words. Aiko is a basic Bot which will get more advanced over time through updates. This repo is used to submit new words from users and report bugs.

If you have any questions message me. You can also add me on Discord: Shy Devil#0001


## How do I submit a new word?
Its possible that some words may slip through Aiko's Detection System for bad words. Of course we want this to be fixed, therfore you can create a new issue here on this repo. If the word that has been submitted is valid it is going to be added into the wordlist for the Bot.
